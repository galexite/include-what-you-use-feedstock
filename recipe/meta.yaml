  summary: 'A tool for use with clang to analyze #includes in C and C++ source files'
  description: |
    "Include what you use" means this: for every symbol (type, function, variable, or macro)
    that you use in foo.cc (or foo.cpp), either foo.cc or foo.h should include a .h file that
    exports the declaration of that symbol. (Similarly, for foo_test.cc, either foo_test.cc or foo.h
    should do the including.) Obviously symbols defined in foo.cc itself are excluded from this requirement.
